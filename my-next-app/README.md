This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server & then run the backend server:
I have created a back-end server by using nodejs and mongodb for performing CRUD operations.

For starting dev server need to install package related dependecies:
For front-end:

********\myapp\my-next-app> npm install


********\myapp\my-next-app> npm run dev

For starting back-end server:

********\myapp\server> npm install


********\myapp\server> node index.js

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
